## About
My partner and I started really getting into word games, and we now do quite a few daily. Unfortuntely I am terrible at the 'Flaggle' iteration, because I don't know flags or country locations well. However we both enjoyed the two iterations of Flaggle we played but often wish there was a combined version that would do a colour comparison and show the distance. And I thought hmm, maybe if I coded something for this it could help me learn a few more flags...Hence 'ultimate-flaggle' was born. 

This application generates a 'random' country each day to guess in under six guesses. After each guess you can see a colour comparison between the flag selected and the flag of the answer. You can also see the distance and the % accuracy of the flag guess.
