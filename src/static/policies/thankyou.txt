Thank Yous ❤️

🌟 Firstly thank you to everyone that has looked at all my iterations of Ultimate Flaggle and spurred me on to get through the front end (in particular Wayne, Luke and Dom).

🌟 Thank you to my lovely testing crew James, Wayne, George, Amber, Charles, Dom, Luke and Edd.

🌟 Thank you to Chat GPT for getting me out of some tight spots and the pure pain of front end coding...you are truly the best search engine for code!

🌟 Finally an extra special thank you to James for the inspiration, and forcing me to play flaggle every day to the point where I actually know some flags now.
Thank you for putting up with my hyperfixation periods of coding constantly.
Thank you for all the days of puzzles and streaks, making the near midnight deadlines and generally adding consistency to my life.

This app is dedicated to you now and for forever - enjoy. 🌷
